# uwc_rhel_update

#### the objective for this is to configure the universal wellpad controller for rhel servers. currently its only for ubuntu.  pre-requisites for this to work are the following:

- rhel 8.3
- rhel 8 kernel-rt patches
- podman 3.x - currently testing with docker-ce for centos ($server-release) as the rhel repos for docker seem to be not working
